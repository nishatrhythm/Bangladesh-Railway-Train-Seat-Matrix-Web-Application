## 📱 Android App & Traffic Management

### Android Device Redirection
To minimize web server traffic and provide optimal user experience, **Android users are automatically redirected to download the native app**:

- **Automatic Detection**: Smart device detection using multiple methods (User-Agent, Client Hints, Touch Detection)
- **Traffic Optimization**: Reduces server load by directing mobile users to the dedicated app
- **Admin Bypass**: Administrators can access web interface from Android devices when authenticated
- **Download Links**: Direct access to latest APK and updates via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nishatrhythm/Train-Seat-App-Releases/blob/main/README.md)

**Android Detection Methods:**
```python
def is_android_device():
    # User-Agent analysis
    # Client Hints detection  
    # Touch device detection
    # Session-based confirmation
```

### User Authentication Requirements
**Important**: The web application now requires users to provide their own authentication credentials:

- **Auth Token**: Obtain from Bangladesh Railway/Shohoz API
- **Device Key**: Unique device identifier for API access
- **Local Storage**: Credentials stored securely in browser only
- **No Server Storage**: Credentials never transmitted to our servers

**Getting Credentials:**
1. Visit Bangladesh Railway/Shohoz official app or website
2. Obtain valid Auth Token and Device Key
3. Enter credentials in the web application
4. Credentials are stored locally in your browser

### Admin Access from Android
Administrators can bypass Android restrictions using environment-configured access codes:
- **Route**: `/admin` - Administrative control panel
- **Authentication**: Environment variable `ADMIN_ACCESS_CODE`
- **Features**: System configuration, maintenance mode, banner management
- **Session Management**: Persistent admin session across requests

---

## 🔐 Authentication System

### User-Provided Authentication

The application now uses **user-provided authentication credentials** instead of server-side hardcoded credentials. Users must supply their own Auth Token and Device Key obtained from Bangladesh Railway/Shohoz API.

**Features:**
- **User-Supplied Credentials**: Auth Token and Device Key provided by users
- **Local Storage**: Credentials stored securely in browser localStorage only
- **Bearer Token Authentication**: Uses JWT tokens for all API requests
- **Client-Side Management**: No server storage of user credentials
- **Error Recovery**: Handles invalid credentials gracefully
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Implements backoff strategies for API limits

### Token Lifecycle Management
- **User Input**: Credentials entered through web interface
- **Browser Storage**: Persistent storage in localStorage
- **Manual Refresh**: Users can update credentials as needed
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for authentication failures

---

## 🧠 Core Logic

### 🚂 Train Matrix Computation

The heart of the application lies in `matrixCalculator.py`, which implements:

```python
def compute_matrix(train_model: str, journey_date_str: str, api_date_format: str) -> dict
```

**Process Flow:**
1. **Train Route Fetching**: Gets complete route with all stations and timings
2. **Parallel API Calls**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent seat availability checks
3. **Matrix Construction**: Builds N×N matrix for all station-to-station combinations
4. **Fare Aggregation**: Processes multiple seat classes (S_CHAIR, SNIGDHA, AC_B, etc.)

### 🔄 Smart Route Finding Algorithm

Three intelligent routing strategies:

#### 1. Direct Routes
```javascript
// Checks for direct tickets between origin and destination
const directRoute = fareMatrices[seatType][origin][destination];
```

#### 2. Segmented Routes (Same Class)
```javascript
// Finds optimal path through intermediate stations
function findRoutes(origin, destination, seatType, stations, fareMatrices)
```

#### 3. Mixed-Class Routes
```javascript
// Uses different seat classes for different segments
function findMixedRoutes(origin, destination, stations, fareMatrices, seatTypes)
```

### 📊 Seat Type Processing

Supports all Bangladesh Railway seat classes:
- **S_CHAIR** (Shovan Chair)
- **SHOVAN** (Shovan)
- **SNIGDHA** (Snigdha)
- **F_SEAT** (First Class Seat)
- **F_CHAIR** (First Class Chair)
- **AC_S** (AC Seat)
- **F_BERTH** (First Class Berth)
- **AC_B** (AC Berth)
- **SHULOV** (Shulov)
- **AC_CHAIR** (AC Chair)

---

## 🧮 Matrix Algorithm

### Data Structure
```python
fare_matrices = {
    "seat_type": {
        "from_station": {
            "to_station": {
                "online": int,     # Available seats
                "offline": int,    # Counter seats
                "fare": float,     # Base fare
                "vat_amount": float # VAT amount
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Concurrent Processing
- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Parallel API calls for all route segments
- **Max Workers**: Dynamically calculated based on route complexity
- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second timeout per API call
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failed requests

### Matrix Visualization
- **Color-coded Cells**: Available (green), unavailable (gray), disabled (diagonal)
- **Fare Display**: Shows total fare including VAT and charges
- **Direct Links**: Click-to-buy integration with official booking system
- **Responsive Design**: Horizontal scroll on mobile devices

---

### 3. Mobile Optimization
- **Responsive Tables**: Horizontal scroll with sticky headers
- **Touch-friendly Controls**: Large tap targets for mobile interaction
- **Optimized Layout**: Single-column layout on small screens

### 4. Date Intelligence
```javascript
// Handles overnight journeys with proper date calculation
const hasSegmentedDates = stations.some(station => 
    stationDates[station] !== date
);
```

### 5. Train Discovery System
```javascript
// API endpoint for finding trains between stations
const response = await fetch('/search_trains', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ origin: origin, destination: destination })
});
```

---

## ⏳ Queue Management

### Advanced Request Queue (`request_queue.py`)

**Features:**
- **Concurrent Limiting**: Configurable max concurrent requests
- **Cooldown Periods**: Prevents API flooding
- **Request Prioritization**: FIFO with abandonment detection
- **Health Monitoring**: Tracks processing times and success rates
- **Auto-cleanup**: Removes stale requests and results

**Configuration:**
```json
{
    "queue_max_concurrent": 1,
    "queue_cooldown_period": 3,
    "queue_batch_cleanup_threshold": 10,
    "queue_cleanup_interval": 30,
    "queue_heartbeat_timeout": 60
}
```

**Process Flow:**
1. Request submitted → Added to queue
2. Queue position displayed to user
3. Request processed when slot available
4. Results cached and delivered
5. Automatic cleanup of completed requests

---

```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory for admin access (optional):
```bash
# Admin Access Control (Optional)
ADMIN_ACCESS_CODE=your_admin_code
```

**Security Notes:**
- The `.env` file is already added to `.gitignore` and won't be committed
- Admin access code enables administrative features and Android bypass functionality
- No user credentials are stored server-side - users provide their own authentication

### 4. Configure Application
Edit `config.json` for customization:
```json

    "version": "1.0.0",
    "is_maintenance": 0,
    "queue_max_concurrent": 1,
    "queue_cooldown_period": 3,
    "queue_enabled": true
}
```

### 5. Run Application
```bash
python app.py
```

**Production Deployment:**
```bash
# With Gunicorn (recommended for production)
gunicorn app:app --log-level=info --access-logfile=-
```

**Logging Output:**
The application will display structured logs including:
- Timestamp and log level
- User submissions with device/browser information
- API request details and response status
- Queue management and processing events
- Error tracking and system health monitoring
